# This software is developed by Andrea Sgambelluri to provide a basic skeleton for the orchestration of different domais.
It includes:
- a folder (controllers) where the client for the different controllers is included
- a config file (config.conf)
- the main functional module (orchestratorAPI.py)

# Create a venv
```
python -m venv venv
```

# Activate the venv
```
venv/SCrits/activate
```

# Run the orchestrator
```
python orchestratorAPI.py
```
